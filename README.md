# HomeBrew Tap

Some brew taps that I developed myself or secondary development

## Taps

### Secondary development

- [trash](https://github.com/BlackHole1/trash) Small command-line program for OS X that moves files or folders to the trash. (Based on https://github.com/ali-rantakari/trash)
    - Do not report an error when the path does not exist
    - Without parameters, nothing is output
    - `I386` and `x86_64` are no longer supported
    - Delete `Finder.sdef` and `trash.pod` file
    - Add the `-h` parameter
